A small website using HTML and CSS of a friend.

It was a really fun project even though it took a few days for me to get through it.
This reminded me to plan out the layout of the website before anything else either using gimp or paint.net and use borders color to seperate your divs! Using the border colors helped me visually what was going on in the website and helped me what css tools are used for like:

-Margin
-Padding
-Flex rules


However one thing that I will fix on this project if I wanted to keep on going with it is to practice more width and height on images resizes since each time I would resize the image the page would be unresponsive and the divs would be messed up. As this regularly happened to me when I was working on the second section of the page.
